# Lovely Github

This is the LovelyGithub application repository. This app was made with React and scss, to demonstrate how well I work
with HTML, CSS, JS and React. I decided to implement all components to show up my independecy and autonomy on creating new design systems or requirements.

# How to run LovelyGithub application:

## Method 1 -Local development enviroment:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all node packages dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Method 2 - Local production version:

### Build the application

1° Run: `npm install`

It will install all node dependencies for the project.

2° Then: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### Serve the application

Run `npm install -g serve` to install 'serve' library globally on your machine.

In the project directory, you can run: `serve -s build`

Serve the static site on the port 3000.

# How to test LovelyGithub application:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all node packages dependencies.

### `npm run test-all`

Trigger a test run at src folder to test all components.
